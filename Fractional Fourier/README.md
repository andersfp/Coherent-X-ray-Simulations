# Developments of wavefront propagation using the fractional Fourier transform

Here is a long list of scripts and function used for developing the fractional Fourier transform wavefront simulation tool. It is described in the following journal article:  
"The fractional Fourier transform as a simulation tool for lens-based X-ray microscopy".  
Anders F. Pedersen, Hugh Simons, Carsten Detlefs, and Henning F. Poulsen.  
Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, vol. 25 (2018), p. 717-728.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600577518003028  

The code is not very well organized here, so I will encourage people to start in my other git repository specifically for this X-ray wavefront simulation package: andersfp/XFrFT.
