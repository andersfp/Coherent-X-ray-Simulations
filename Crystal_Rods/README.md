# Crystal truncation rods in resolution function

Here is a small script for calculating the crystal trunction rod angles of a triple-crystal diffractometer. The calculations are based on equations in the following journal article:  
"The Resolution Function of a Triple-Crystal Diffractometer for High-Energy Synchrotron Radiation. II. Dispersive Laue Geometry".  
U. RÃ¼tt, H.-B. Neumann, H. F. Poulsen, and J. R. Schneider.
Journal of Applied Crystallography, vol. 28 (1995), p. 729-737.

Plot of the CTR rods are made using the two scripts (basically identical, except one redefines the energy). The .png images shows results with different combinations of signs of the q-value for each crystal (it is not quite clear which way is correct).
