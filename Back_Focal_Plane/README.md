# Back focal plane simulations

Here are a number of scripts for simulating the intensity in the back focal plane (BFP) and image plane of an objective lens. There are different combinations of partial longitudinal (aka. L or Long) and transverse (aka. T or Trans) coherence. This has no effect on the image plane, whereas the intensity in the BFP gets smeared out increasingly for lower coherence lengths.

The results are found in the .png image files, and these have been made with some of the MatLab scripts.

The results are also found in the following journal article:
