# Phase contrast for images with MLL lenses

Here are forward simulations mimicking an experiment conducted with MLL objective lenses. A cone shaped gold rod is put in the direct beam, and a set of 1D MLLs are used as an objective lens. Images are acquired at both sides of the image plane, and the edge pattern is examined.
