# Experimental demonstration of Objective BCDI

Each sub-folder contains scripts for reconstruction of 3D BCDI data with and without an objective lens.
- Hole: Traditional BCDI without a lens, hoever data is recorded through a transmission hole in the CRL objective lens. This shows the effect of the kapton foil and increased air scattering.
- No_Lens: Traditional BCDI without an objective lens.
- Real: BCDI with a CRL objective lens with N = 70 lenslets and a geometry that forms a real image between the objective lens and the detector.
- Virtual: BCDI with a CRL objective lens with N = 20 lenslets and a geometry that produces a virtual image (i.e. no real image is formed).

See each sub-folder for more details. The results have been put on ArXiV:
