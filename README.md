# Coherent X-ray Simulations

This repository contains the most important MatLab files from my PostDoc at DTU Physics, in the group of Professor Henning Friis Poulsen. I have uploaded the basic MatLab scripts and functions that I have developed for fractional Fourier transform wavefront propagation, lensless imaging with a lens reconstructions, and 3D probe ptychography reconstructions. I hope that someone else will be able to continue and expand these projects on the basis of this code.

Inside each sub-folder, corresponding to a different project, there is a separate README file that gives a short description of the MatLab scripts and data. The folder called "Functions" contains most of MatLab function, and these are called from the scripts found in other subfolders.

Data files with simulation results have not been included, so the data paths in the scripts need to be updated acording to your own system.

Feel free to leave comments if the documentation is not adequate.
